run_lambda contains two functions to run a piece of code specified by a file (could just be a string)
 1) executeFileWithProtection
 2) executeFileWithoutProtection (this is just to contrast against the other, it's just parsing, compiling, and executing the file)

The other three files are for a testcase.
To run that, do python main_test.py

See comments in run_lambda.py for details on what is happening

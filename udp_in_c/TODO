Current progress: 

1. (done)
2. (done)
3. (I don't think we need to do this, so skipping)
4. (done but not tested)

--------------------------------
Descriptions

1. Use simple timeout-retry mechanism to:
   Detect when receiver has not received a message.
   Resend until receiver sends acknowledgment.
   Send code should be blocking.

2. Update to use actual timer instead of just a variable placeholder

3. Update that to use a sequence counter. 
   This solves one specific issue: if acknowledgment is lost.
   In using a counter, we ensure that the message on receiving end is
   NOT received multiple times (as would be the case if it was sent multiple
   times intentionally!)

4. Timing exercises?
